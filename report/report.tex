	We have solved the 2D time-dependent Schrödinger equation numerically for a single particle
	interacting with different slit configurations. We used a Guassian wave packet as the initial state of the wave function.
	The slits we simulated were the single, double and triple slit configuration.
	To solve the Schrödinger equation, we used the
	Crank-Nicolson approach. For the convergence check of our numerical solution, we verified that the probability of finding the particle inside the box remained 1 at all times. The total probability was conserved within an
	error margin of  $10^{-14}$. We studied the particle's probability distribution for the position at a certain time and explored the detection probability through the three kinds of slit configurations. As expected, we observed interference patterns in the probability distribution for the double and triple slit configurations.

	\section{Introduction} \label{sec:introduction}
	% ===========================================
	\noindent
	Light has always been an intriguing phenomenon in physics. It began in ancient Greece when Democritus argued that all things in the universe are composed of indivisible
	sub-components, i.e., particles. At the beginning of the eleventh century Ibn al-Haytham
	wrote a physics book describing light no longer as a particle but as a wave, using a
	pinhole lens to reflect, and refract rays of light. This started a heated debate about the
	wave-particle duality of light. All physicists joined one of the two sides and tried to
	prove that light was either a wave or a particle. \\
	\noindent \\
	In 1801, Thomas Young developed the double-slit experiment from the Huygens-Fresnel principle
	resulting in the discovery of wave interference of light\cite{ThomasYoung}.
	This experiment did not solve the debate, but the wave property of light began to dominate
	scientific thinking. We will need the introduction of Quantum Mechanics to show that
	light can behave as a particle and as a wave. The Schrödinger equation, being derived
	from the wave equation, is an important equation in Quantum mechanics and it can be used to solve the time evolution of the probability for the position 
	of a particle.  \\

	\noindent
	In this report, we use the 2D time-dependent Schrödinger equation to simulate a particle's
	motion in different slit configurations, namely no slit, one, two or three slits. Since the equation is a partial differential equation (PDE), similar to the heat equation, we will apply the Crank-Nicolson method.
	Originally this finite difference method was used to solve the heat equation\cite{Crank1947APM}. \\

	\noindent
	In section \ref{sec:theory} we will overview the theoretical aspect of our problem by introducing
	the Schrödinger equation with some light quantum mechanical motion. Then in section \ref{sec:methods}
	we will introduce the Crank-Nicolson approach for solving PDEs. We will also go through the simulations setup. Furthermore, we briefly introduce all results obtained from the simulations in section
	\ref{sec:results}. Finally, we discuss our results in section \ref{sec:discussion}, and provide a summary
	in section \ref{sec:conclusion}.

	% ===========================================
	\section{Theory} \label{sec:theory}
	% ===========================================
	The time-dependent Schrödinger equation is defined as

	\begin{equation}
	i \hbar \frac{d}{d t}|\Psi\rangle=\hat{H}|\Psi\rangle \label{eq:schro_eq},
	\end{equation}

	\noindent
	where $\hat{H}$ is the Hamiltonian operator representing the total energy of the system
	and $|\Psi\rangle$ is the vector state in the Hilbert space. $|\Psi\rangle$ is a vector
	containing all possible information on the system at a specific time $t$. However, the actual physical meaning of $|\Psi\rangle$ remains an open question as it is impossible to
	physically observe $|\Psi\rangle$ \cite{griffiths:quantumn}. To obtain the information
	from $|\Psi\rangle$, we have to apply a certain operator on it, giving us a probability
	through the well known Born rule.\\

	\noindent
	In this paper, we will consider the case of a single, non-relativistic particle in two dimensions.
	We will also work in the position space to express our vector
	in terms of the orthonormal basis of the position space $|x_i\rangle$. This allows us, from Born rule, to calculate the probability of finding our particle at
	$x_i$, with the discretization of  $|\Psi\rangle$,  at time $t_n$

	\begin{equation}
		P(x_i;t_n) = \langle x_i |\Psi\rangle = |\Psi^n_i|^2 =  \Psi^{n\dagger}_i\Psi^n_i,
	\end{equation}

	\noindent
	with $\Psi^\dagger$ being the complex-conjugate and assuming normalization of $
	|\Psi\rangle$. \\

	\noindent
	By writing out the 2D Hamiltonian operator, we can rewrite eq. \ref{eq:schro_eq} into


	\begin{align*}
		& \quad i \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \Psi(x, y, t)= \\
		& \left[-\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2 m}\left(\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial x^{2}}+\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial y^{2}}\right)+V(x, y, t)\right] \Psi(x, y, t) \tag{2}. \label{eq:explicit_scho}
	\end{align*}

	\noindent
	To simplify our simulation, we will scale away all dimensions in \eqref{eq:explicit_scho}.
	
	% ===========================================
	\section{Methods}\label{sec:methods}
	% ===========================================
	\subsection{The Bare Schrödinger Equation}
	\noindent
	The bare Schrödinger equation is dimentionless and can be written as 

	\begin{equation}\label{eq:bare Schrodinger}
		\begin{split}
		i \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} &= -\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} - \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} + v(x,y) u\\
		\Rightarrow \ \ \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} &= i\left(\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2}\right) - iv(x,y) u,
		\end{split}
	\end{equation} 
	where $u$ is the dimensionless wave-function in two dimensions.
	In order to solve equation \ref{eq:bare Schrodinger} numerically, we must discetize all the terms and approximate
	the derivatives. The discretization is done by introducing a grid of points in the
	$xy$ plane containing all the values of $x$ and $y$ we will use. The time is discretized by using points, with equal spacing, along the time axis.\\ \\
	The first order time derivative on the left hand side of equation \ref{eq:bare Schrodinger} is approximated using the forward Euler method given by
	\begin{equation}
		\frac{\partial u^{n}}{\partial t} \approx \frac{u^{n+1}-u^n}{\Delta t},
	\end{equation}

	\noindent
	where the superscript of $u^n$ denotes the time point of $u$ and $\Delta t$ is the length of the time
	step, i.e. the spacing between points on the time axis.	For the second order spatial derivatives
	on the right hand side of equation \ref{eq:bare Schrodinger}
	we use Taylor approximations of second order. In the $x$ direction,
	the double spatial derivative is then given by
	
	\begin{equation}\label{ex:double x}
		\frac{\partial^2 u_{i,j}}{\partial x^2} \approx \frac{u_{i+1,j}-2u_{i,j}+u_{i-1,j}}{h^2},
	\end{equation}
	where the subscript denotes the $x$ and $y$ spatial points and $h$ is the spatial step size.
	The equation for the $y$ direction is a matter of flipping the variables from
	$x \rightarrow y$ and $i \rightarrow j$.
	in equation \ref{ex:double x}.
	\subsection{The Crank-Nicolson Approach}
	
	\noindent
	The approximations for the derivatives are used in
	the Crank-Nicolson approach, which is given by
	
	\begin{equation}
		\frac{u^{n+1}-u^{n}}{\Delta t} = \frac{1}{2}    \left(     F^{n+1} + F^n     \right),
	\end{equation}

	\noindent
	where the $F^{n+1}$ and $F^n$ terms are the right hand side of equation \ref{eq:bare Schrodinger}
	evaluated at the specified time points. The superscript denotes the time point of the given variable, and $\Delta t$ is the length of the time step,
	i.e. the spacing between points on the time axis.\\

	\noindent
	Rewriting equation \ref{eq:bare Schrodinger}
	according to the Crank-Nicolson approach we get 
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:algo}
		\begin{aligned}
		\frac{u^{n+1}_{i,j}-u^{n}_{i,j}}{\Delta t} &=  \frac{1}{2}\Big[\left(i\left(\frac{\partial^2 u_{i,j}}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u_{i,j}}{\partial y^2}\right) -i v_{i,j} u_{i,j}\right)^{n+1} \\
	    &+   \left(i(\frac{\partial^2 u_{i,j}}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u_{i,j}}{\partial y^2}) -i v_{i,j} u_{i,j}\right)^{n} \Big]\\
	    &\ \\
		&=  \frac{1}{2}\Big(    \frac{i}{h^2}\big(  u^{n+1}_{i+1,j}-2u^{n+1}_{i,j}+u^{n+1}_{i-1,j}   +u^{n+1}_{i,j+1}\\
		&-2u^{n+1}_{i,j}+u^{n+1}_{i,j-1}\big)-iv_{i,j}u^{n+1}_{i,j}\\
		&+ \frac{i}{h^2}\big(  u^{n}_{i+1,j}-2u^{n}_{i,j}+u^{n}_{i-1,j}   +u^{n}_{i,j+1}\\
		&-2u^{n}_{i,j}+u^{n}_{i,j-1}\big)-iv_{i,j}u^{n}_{i,j}      \Big)\\ 
		&\ \\
		&\Rightarrow \\ 
		&\ \\
		&u^{n+1}_{i,j} -r\Big(  u^{n+1}_{i+1,j}-2u^{n+1}_{i,j}+u^{n+1}_{i-1,j} \\
		&+u^{n+1}_{i,j+1}-2u^{n+1}_{i,j}+u^{n+1}_{i,j-1}\Big) +\frac{i\Delta t}{2}v_{i,j}u^{n+1}_{i,j}\\
		&\ \\
		&= u^n_{i,j}+ r\Big(  u^{n}_{i+1,j}-2u^{n}_{i,j}+u^{n}_{i-1,j}\\
		&+u^{n}_{i,j+1}-2u^{n}_{i,j}+u^{n}_{i,j-1}\Big)-\frac{i\Delta t}{2}v_{i,j}u^{n}_{i,j},
		\end{aligned}
	\end{equation}
	\noindent
	where we have used that $r = \frac{i\Delta t}{2h^2}$. The terms at time
	point $n+1$ are on the left hand side and terms at time point $n$ are on the right
	hand side.\\
	

	\subsection{The Simulated System}
	\noindent
	We consider a simulation box where $x \in [0,1]$, $y \in [0,1]$ and $t \in [0,T]$. The $x$ and $y$ axes are discetized such
	that there are $M-1$ points along each axis including the boundaries.
	We use the Dirichlet boundary conditions in the $xy$ plane, i.e.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $u(x=0, y, t) = 0$
		\item $u(x=1, y, t) = 0$
		\item $u(x, y=0, t) = 0$ 
		\item $u(x, y=1, t) = 0$,
	\end{itemize}
	so we do not need to calculate the boundaries at every time point. We do, however, need 
	to take the boundaries into consideration when calculating the inner points of the $xy$ grid.
	The inner points of the $xy$ grid are given by the indices $i \in [1,M-2]$ and 
	$j \in [1,M-2]$. These are the only indices we need in order to
	calculate the time evolution of the system.	As we see from the result of equation \ref{eq:algo},
	there will be one equation for each unique combination of $i$ and $j$.
	Since there are $(M-2)^2$ combinations of $i$ and $j$, there will be 
	$(M-2)^2$ equations we need to solve.  
	By organizing all the $u_{i,j}$ variables into one column vector, 
	we see that we can rewrite the result of equation \ref{eq:algo} into
	a matrix equation on the form 
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:matrix equation}
		Au^{n+1} = Bu^n,	
	\end{equation} 	
	where $A$ and $B$ are matrices. The $A$ matrix contains all the coefficients in all the equations
	for the $u_{i,j}$ variables at time point $n+1$. The $B$ matrix is the same matrix as $A$ at time point $n$.
	Since $A$ and $B$ are time invariant matrices,
	we only need an initial condition of $u$ to solve the matrix equation and evolve the system forward to
	time point $n+1$. This can be repeated to get the time evolution of the system.\\ \\
	\noindent
	For the initial condition of the dimensionless wave-function in two dimensions,
	i.e. $u^{0}$, we use an un-normalized Gaussian wave packet given by
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:wave packet}
	\begin{split}
		u(x,y,t=0) = \exp\Big(&-\frac{(x-x_c)^2}{2 \sigma_x^2} - \frac{(y-y_c)^2}{2 \sigma_y^2} \\
		&+ i p_x (x-x_c) + i p_y (y-y_c)\Big). \\
	\end{split}
	\end{equation}
	\noindent
	In equation \ref{eq:wave packet}, $x_c$ and $y_c$ are the central
	coordinates of the wave packet, $\sigma_x$ and $\sigma_y$ are the standard
	deviations in the $x$ and $y$ directions respectively and $p_x$ and $p_y$
	are the momenta of the wave packet. We must also normalize the probability
	distribution, such that the total probability is one. This can be done by
	demanding that 
	\begin{equation}
		\sum\limits_{i,j} u^{0*}_{ij} \, u^0_{ij} = 1.
	\end{equation}

	\noindent
	The wave packet simulates the wavefunction of a particle. The wave packet probability
	will then simulate the probability for finding the particle at a given 
	place at a given time. 
	\\ \\
	\noindent
	The potential, $V$, we use to simulate the slits is zero everywhere except 
	for the locations where the barrier is located. The potential in the
	barrier will be constant and given by $v_0$.

	\section{Results}\label{sec:results}

	\noindent
	We now present the results for the no-slit and the two-slit systems, using the parameter values in table \ref{tab:1}. We have used the potential in figure \ref{fig:potential} for the double slit.
	The resulting absolute error of the total probability of these systems can, as functions of time, be seen in figure \ref{fig:prob7_error}. We observe
	that the error is of size $10^{-14}$, and it grows with time.

	We then find how the wave packet probability propagates through the two-slit system. We created a playlist of animations for the propagation of the probability function though time,  but we included snapshots from the animations here, first at time $t=0$.

	The particles position is observed to have a positive non-zero probability on
	both sides of the slits.

	\section{Discussion}\label{sec:discussion}
	% ===========================================
\subsection{Total probability deviation} \label{subsec:tot_prob_dev}
	\noindent
	An important aspect of numerical analysis is ensuring that the numerical
	solution does not diverge. It is crucial, especially when no
	analytical solutions exist or are known. For example, in the case of a
	Newtonian system of equations, we usually have energy conservation,
	so checking that our energy is conserved is a good indicator that our
	results are reasonable. In the case of quantum mechanics, since we
	can only observe probabilities, one good convergence check is to ensure
	that our total probability is 1 at all times during our simulation. \\
	\noindent \\
	In figure \ref{fig:prob7_error}, we have plotted the absolute error of
	the total probability $|P_{\rm tot} - 1|$ for all time steps.
	Our total probability is always close to the theoretical
	value of 1 with an error margin of $10^{-14}$. This suggests that our results
	are reasonable.\\
	
	\noindent
	We made a function in our python script to make sure that all our
	simulations pass the conservation of total probability test.

	\subsection{Color-map of the wave function and probability distribution}\label{subsec:colormap}
	\noindent
	We have simulated the double-slit experiment numerically using the parameters found in
	table \ref{tab:1}. We have also plotted the real and imaginary part of the wavefunction and the probability
	distribution at times $t \in \{0, 0.001, 0.002 \}$. \\

	\noindent
	At $t=0$ figures \ref{fig:prob8_Im0}, \ref{fig:prob8_Re0} and \ref{fig:prob_P0} show the imaginary part, the real part and the probability distribution
	of our initial Gaussian wave-packet. We also notice that the real and imaginary
	parts have opposite values, making the complex norm look like our expected probability distribution. \\

	\noindent
	At $t=0.001$ Figures \ref{fig:prob8_Im1}, \ref{fig:prob8_Re1} and \ref{fig:prob8_P1}
	represent our particle hitting the double-slit configuration. We first see that the
	particle only moves in the $x$-direction, which is as expected because it's the direction where the momentum was initiated. When the particle hits the slit configuration, we can see that it behaves like a wave, with some parts being reflected with negative and positive values due to the constructive or destructive interference pattern. On the other side, we can see that a part of the wave went through the slit but has not shown self-interaction yet. \\

	\noindent
	The plot for our final time stamp $t=0.002$ are represented by
	figures \ref{fig:prob8_Im2}, \ref{fig:prob8_Re2} and \ref{fig:prob8_P2}.
	This time shows the wave function after it has passed the double slit configuration.
	We now observe interference patterns in both the reflected and transmitted parts. This is expected, as a wave will interact with itself. We can see that the particle has a greater probability of being reflected than moving through due to the size difference
	between the slit, the wall and the initial probability wave packet. We can observe two spots of high probability in
	the reflected part ($x\approx0.3$, $y\approx0.60$ and $y\approx0.30$). This is due to constructive interference.
	\\
	\noindent \\
	We see three main regions on the transmitted part, one more probable than the others. The wave spreading creates an interference pattern, meaning we observe minima and maxima. \\
	\noindent \\
	The real and imaginary parts of the wave function can not be described physically as it is impossible to observe. We can only give some physical sense when we put them
	together by calculating the complex norm giving us the probability distribution. We can
	see that all imaginary and real parts have a similar behaviour to the probability wave.\\

	\subsection{Detection Probability} \label{subsec:detec_prob}
	\noindent
	One last interesting thing we look at is the detection probability of our particle.
	To simulate this, we imagin a detector screen at $x=0.8$ and look at the probability
	distribution along that line. We assume that we detect the particle somewhere along the line, so we normalized the probability distribtion along the line so that the sum of all probabilities goes to 1. We used this method
	for our three slit configuration plotted in Figures \ref{fig:prob9_single}, \ref{fig:prob9_double}
	and \ref{fig:prob9_triple}. \\
	\noindent \\
	For the single slit, we see a Gaussian like profile around the centre where the slit
	is located. In that case, the wave interacts with itself, but no interference is present.	For the
	double slit, we see one maximum at the centre and two secondary maxima on the edges. We now observe some interference patterns due to the slit configuration making the wave interfere constructively on the maxima and destructively in between them. Finally, for
	the triple slit, we observe an interference pattern with four maxima and three
	minima. However, we do not observe the maxima around the centre. One interesting thing would be to use the classical wave equation, solve the slit configuration, and compare it with our results.
	\subsection{Solving the matrix equation}
	\noindent
	The matrix multiplication of $Bu^n$ results in a new vector we can call $b$.
	The matrix equation \ref{eq:matrix equation} can then be rewritten as
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:matrix equation rewritten}
		Au^{n+1} = b
	\end{equation}
	When solving this equation, we can utilize that the matrix $A$ is a symmetric matrix. The $A$ matrix aslo has
	the same entries on the diagonal, meaning that $A$ can be split into three parts, such that $A = L+ D + U$, where $L$ is the lower part,
	$D$ is the diagonal part and $U$ is the upper part.  
	An algorithm that is specialized for symmetric matrices with equal entries on the diagonal can therefore be 
	used when solving equation \ref{eq:matrix equation rewritten}.

	\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
	% ===========================================
	\noindent
	In this paper we simulated a single non-relativistic particle obeying 
	Schrödinger's equation through three types of slit setup, single, double
	and triple slit. We observed that most of the wave-
	function was reflected while a small part passed through when we included slits. We observed the 
	interference pattern, similar to that for a wave. The detection probability if we would have placed 
	a detector screen behind the wall at $x=0.8$ was found, and the maxima and 
	minima of the detection probability due to constructive or destructive interference was observed. All simulations passed the convergence check by conserving the total 
	probability with a negligible error of $\sim 10^{-14}$. \\
